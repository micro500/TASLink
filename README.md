TASLink is a series of hardware and supporting software built around the Papilio Pro FPGA development board designed for interfacing with consoles. The hardware is in the form of "wings" (or "shields") that can be attached depending on the situation. There is currently hardware for NES/SNES and the N64.

### NES/SNES

Cables were built with Eurocable brand CAT5 which is foil+braided shielded with a thick jacket. Heatshrink was added for extra strain relief.
